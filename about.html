		<h2>Why Software Development?</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				  By the time I was getting ready to graduate highschool, I had to very quickly decide on what I wanted to do with my life. 
				With not much time to spare, I wracked my brain trying to figure out what seemed interesting to me. 
			    What were some things that I liked that could also be a potential career? 
				Over the span of one month, I went over the list of my interests and hobbies that could lead to an answer, when it dawned on me. 
			    How about video games? Growing up, I used to watch my older brothers play video games, and started enjoying them myself in my teens.
			    Had I ever thought about how they are made? No. Would it be interesting to learn? Absolutely! 
				Within the span of two months, I finally decided my goals for the future. That is, to eventually become an indie game developer.
			</p><br>

		<h2>Personal Life</h2>

		<div>
			<p>
				I was born in a small town in Northern California called Greenwood,
				and moved to Idaho when I was almost two years old. 
				I am the youngest of five, with a sister and three brothers.
				Since my older brothers were the catalyst for my love of gaming,
				it is something I enjoy doing with them. Because my sister is an awesome human, I am also proud aunt of three of the cutest kids ever. 
				Fun fact: My dad is Chinese and my mom is Japanese. Making me, a super hybrid Asian. 
			    I am also a huge cat person, to the point I never want to be without one. 
			</p><br>
		</div>
		<h2>Interests</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				I have spent close to ten years as a figure skater, and spent almost five years teaching basic skills to kids. 
				Skating will always be something I look back on fondly, and is something I enjoy practicing when I have the chance.
				In addition to playing video games,
				I also enjoy listening to music, watching anime,
				and consuming other various types of mostly Asian entertainment. I also love cooking Japanese food. 
				I am currently learning Japanese and how to play the guitar.
